require 'rails_helper'


   # As a merchant employee
#   When I visit my items page
#   And I click the edit button or link next to any item
# Then I am taken to a form similar to the 'new item' form
# The form is pre-populated with all of this item's information
# I can change any information, but all of the rules for adding a new item still apply:
# - name and description cannot be blank
# - price cannot be less than $0.00
# - inventory must be 0 or greater
#
# When I submit the form
# I am taken back to my items page
# I see a flash message indicating my item is updated
# I see the item's new information on the page, and it maintains its previous enabled/disabled state
# If I left the image field blank, I see a placeholder image for the thumbnail
